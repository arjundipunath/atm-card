Frosted Glass Effect Card with Shape Overlay
This repository contains a simple HTML/CSS project that demonstrates the creation of a frosted glass effect card with a shape overlay. The design is inspired by modern UI/UX trends, such as those seen in ATM cards and other financial applications. The card features a frosted glass effect, using CSS properties like backdrop-filter and box-shadow, and a shape overlay that can be customized to cover text or other elements, similar to a masked number on an ATM card.

Features

Customizable Shape Overlay: A shape overlay that covers specific content, useful for masking sensitive information like numbers or text.
